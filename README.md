difficulties:
I attempted to code in object-oriented programming but was not successful. I attempted this a few times before I scraped my code and started new. After this, I had problems making the “ant” or player move correctly using the keys and creating a list of ants but found resources to solve this problem. I used a list to create the snake effect. I could not include my image of an ant for the player because it would not work when I did. I also had a hard time finding a way to use collision detection in pygame so instead, I used X and Y positions to determine if two sprites came in contact. This led to another issue because when the player collides with a “food” or “trap” it must hit the top left corner in order to be detected. I could not find a solution to this that would not require me to start over again. When I thought I had completed everything correctly my screen was coming up as black when I ran the program and then flashed the game as I exited the program. I figured out this was an issue because I needed to update the screen. My game is now functioning correctly. I was supried at how long it took to complete this project.

What I learned or would do differently:
I enjoyed learning more about pygame and working more independently. I also learned that projects like this take much longer that I expected. I have made games in other languages before and this was a challenge for me. I learned more about object-oriented programming, researching information about python, and how to add music to a program. Mostly I enjoyed playing with the finished product. If I had more time I would correct the issues with the collision. I would also like to add a mini-game inside of the original game where the player would have to go through a maze after colliding with a trap. I would also add more features like a pause button for the music or the entire game.
